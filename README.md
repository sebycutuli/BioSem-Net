Semantic Network for the characters in the web

Before you have to run BioSem-Net' Parser (here https://github.com/sebycutuli/Parser-for-BioSem-Net)

BIOSEM-NET (Acronym of Biography Semantic Network) is the main goal of my thesis. The final objective was to create an approach of design which would allow to have a software capable of simulating a semantic network of the characters existing in Wikipedia.
BIOSEM-NET is a software developed in Java and MySQL in which the final user has the possibility, by a form, to research on a character (who should have at least a biography) and to have as a result a range of information on the character researched and a list of other characters correlated to him.
